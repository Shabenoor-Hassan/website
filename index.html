    <h2>What is Global Warming?</h2>
    <p>Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels. This leads to melting ice caps, rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and disrupted ecosystems.</p>

  <!-- what is happening in the world -->
  <section class="about" id ="about2">
    <p>* A recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) underscored that while we can’t stop global warming from intensifying over the next 30 years, action we take now could still help slow or even stabilize rising temperatures. This is an important issue to our community. Your small steps can save several thousands lives. </p>
